			<p>I completed the Prework</p>
			<p>All I've done is follow the screencast and typed this info in<br></p>
			<p>I've read two and a half of the books of the homework material, <br>but have not done any of the book exercises</p>
			<p>Now as a <em>'start over</em> I need to see if I stay in class, quit, or transfer into the next available class<br></em></p>
			<p>Saturday of three day weekend, I've started re-reading HTML5 and CSS3<br> and I'm @ Appendix C. First half I understood.</p>
			<p>Maybe I need a plan D, Enroll in next available class,</p>
			<p>and hire Ryan as a weekly Tutor to help me out, check on weekly progress, and give me weekly goals to achieve.</p>
